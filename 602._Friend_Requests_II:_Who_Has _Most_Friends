One way of doing it:
SELECT id,
       Count(id) AS num
FROM   (SELECT requester_id AS id
        FROM   request_accepted
        UNION ALL
        SELECT accepter_id
        FROM   request_accepted) ppl
GROUP  BY id
ORDER  BY Count(id) DESC
LIMIT  1 

Another way:
with cte as (
    select requester_id as id, count(*) as c
    from RequestAccepted
    group by requester_id
),
cte2 as (
    select accepter_id as id, count(*) as c
    from RequestAccepted
    group by accepter_id
), cte3 as (
select * from cte
union all
select * from cte2
)
select id, sum(c) as num
from cte3
group by id
order by sum(c) desc
limit 1
